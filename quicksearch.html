A Block will contain the configuration of the channel or transactions on the channel. The description area below shows the properties of the &quot;Block&quot; object. When the property name does not have a data type next to it (e.g. -- {int}) then assume it is an object and the indented names below it are it's properties. Complex properties shown within the description area are listed under the &quot;Properties&quot; section (e.g. {Header}). Use the links under the &quot;Type&quot; column to see the description of that object type. When assigning the results of a block query or block event to a variable called block for example, then to get the block number use var block_num = block.header.number; or to see the first transaction id in the block use var tx_id = block.data.data[0].payload.header.channel_header.tx_id; A &quot;Block&quot; will have the following JSON layout. header number -- {int} previous_hash -- {byte} data_hash -- {byte} data data -- [array] signature -- {byte} payload header -- {Header} data -- {Config | Transaction} metadata metadata -- [array] #each array item has it's own layout [0] #SIGNATURES signatures -- [array] signature_header creator Mspid -- {string} IdBytes -- {byte} nonce -- {byte} signature -- {byte} [1] #LAST_CONFIG value index -- {number} signatures -- [array] signature_header creator Mspid -- {string} IdBytes -- {byte} nonce -- {byte} signature -- {byte} [2] #TRANSACTIONS_FILTER [int] #see TxValidationCode in proto/peer/transaction.proto Type: Object Properties: Name Type Description header Header The header of the block data Config | Transaction The data bytes will be based on the block.header.channel_header.type See: protos/common/common.proto Config The JSON representation of a GRPC message &quot;Config&quot;.

The SDK is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime. OverviewHyperledger Fabric is the operating system of an enterprise-strength permissioned blockchain network. For a high-level overview of the fabric, visit http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Applications can be developed to interact with the blockchain network on behalf of the users. APIs are available to: create channels ask peer nodes to join the channel install chaincodes in peers instantiate chaincodes in a channel invoke transactions by calling the chaincode query the ledger for transactions or blocks How Different Components of the Fabric Work TogetherThe Transaction Flow document provides an excellent description of the application/SDK, peers, and orderers working together to process transactions and producing blocks. Security on the Fabric is enforced with digital signatures. All requests made to the fabric must be signed by users with appropriate enrollment certificates. For a user's enrollment certificate to be considered valid on the Fabric, it must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Fabric supports any standard CAs. In addition, Fabric provides a CA server. See this overview. Features of the SDK for Node.jsThe Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js is designed in an Object-Oriented programming style. Its modular construction enables application developers to plug in alternative implementations of key functions such as crypto suites, the state persistence store, and logging utility. The SDK's list of features include: fabric-client: create a new channel send channel information to a peer to join install chaincode on a peer instantiate chaincode in a channel, which involves two steps: propose and transact submitting a transaction, which also involves two steps: propose and transact query a chaincode for the latest application state various query capabilities: chain height block-by-number, block-by-hash all channels that a peer is part of all installed chaincodes in a peer all instantiated chaincodes in a channel transaction-by-id channel configuration data monitoring events: connect to a peer's event stream listen on block events listen on transactions events and find out if the transaction was successfully committed to the ledger or marked invalid listen on custom events produced by chaincodes serializable User object with signing capabilities hierarchical configuration settings with multiple layers of overrides: files, environment variable, program arguments, in-memory settings logging utility with a built-in logger (winston) and can be overriden with a number of popular loggers including log4js and bunyan pluggable CryptoSuite interface describe the cryptographic operations required for successful interactions with the Fabric. Two implementations are provided out of box: Software-based ECDSA PKCS#11-compliant ECDSA pluggable State Store interface for persisting state caches such as users File-based store CouchDB-base store which works with both CouchDB database and IBM Cloudant customizable Crypto Key Store for any software-based cryptographic suite implementation supports both TLS (grpcs://) or non-TLS (grpc://) connections to peers and orderers, see Remote which is the superclass for peers and orderers fabric-ca-client: register a new user enroll a user to obtain the enrollment certificate signed by the Fabric CA revoke an existing user by enrollment ID or revoke a specific certificate customizable persistence store API ReferenceThe SDK is made up of 3 top-level modules that can be accessed through the navigation menu Modules: api: pluggable APIs for application developers to supply alternative implementations of key interfaces used by the SDK. For each interface there are built-in default implementations. fabric-client: this module provides APIs to interact with the core components of a Hypreledger Fabric-based blockchain network, namely the peers, orderers and event streams. fabric-ca-client: this module provides APIs to interact with the optional component, fabric-ca, that contains services for membership management. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on 2017-05-18T23:57:23-04:00 using the DocStrap template.

The “Chain” object captures settings for a channel, which is created by the orderers to isolate transactions delivery to peers participating on channel. A chain must be initialized after it has been configured with the list of peers and orderers. The initialization sends a get configuration block request to the primary orderer to retrieve the configuration settings for this channel. new Chain(name, clientContext) Parameters: Name Type Description name string to identify different chain instances. The naming of chain instances is enforced by the ordering service and must be unique within the blockchain network clientContext Client An instance of Client that provides operational context such as submitting User etc. Tutorials: Tutorial: app-overview Methods &lt;static&gt; buildTransactionID(nonce, userContext) Utility method to build an unique transaction id based on a nonce and this chain's user. Parameters: Name Type Description nonce int a one time use number userContext User the user context Returns: An unique string Type string addOrderer(orderer) Add orderer endpoint to a chain object, this is a local-only operation. A chain instance may choose to use a single orderer node, which will broadcast requests to the rest of the orderer network.

A client instance provides a handler to interact with a network of peers, orderers and optionally member services. An application using the SDK may need to interact with multiple networks, each through a separate instance of the Client. Each client when initially created should be initialized with configuration data from the consensus service, which includes a list of trusted roots, orderer certificates and IP addresses, and a list of peer certificates and IP addresses that it can access. This must be done out of band as part of bootstrapping the application environment. It is also the responsibility of the application to maintain the configuration of a client as the SDK does not persist this object. Each Client instance can maintain several Chain instances representing channels and the associated private ledgers. new Client() Methods &lt;static&gt; addConfigFile(path) Adds a file to the top of the list of configuration setting files that are part of the hierarchical configuration. These files will override the default settings and be overriden by environment, command line arguments, and settings programmatically set into configuration settings. hierarchy search order: 1. memory - all settings added with sdkUtils.setConfigSetting(name,value) 2. Command-line arguments 3. Environment variables (names will be change from AAA-BBB to aaa-bbb) 4. Custom Files - all files added with the addConfigFile(path) will be ordered by when added, were last one added will override previously added files 5. The file located at 'config/default.json' with default settings Parameters: Name Type Description path String The path to the file to be added to the top of list of configuration files &lt;static&gt; buildTransactionID(nonce, userContext) Utility method to build an unique transaction id based on a nonce and the user context. Parameters: Name Type Description nonce int a one time use number userContext User the user context Returns: An unique string Type string &lt;static&gt; getConfigSetting(name, default_value) Retrieves a setting from the hierarchical configuration and if not found will return the provided default value. hierarchy search order: 1. memory - settings added with sdkUtils.setConfigSetting(name,value) 2.

By default it returns the built-in implementation, which is based on files (FileKeyValueStore). This can be overriden with an environment variable KEY_VALUE_STORE, the value of which is the full path of a CommonJS module for the alternative implementation. Parameters: Name Type Description options Object is whatever the implementation requires for initializing the instance. For the built-in file-based implementation, this requires a single property &quot;path&quot; to the top-level folder for the store Returns: KeyValueStore an instance of the KeyValueStore implementation &lt;static&gt; setConfigSetting(name, value) Adds a setting to override all settings that are part of the hierarchical configuration. hierarchy search order: 1. memory - settings added with this call 2.

The file located at 'config/default.json' with default settings Parameters: Name Type Description name String The name of a setting value Object The value of a setting &lt;static&gt; setLogger(logger) Configures a logger for the entire HFC SDK to use and override the default logger. Unless this method is called, HFC uses a default logger (based on winston). When using the built-in &quot;winston&quot; based logger, use the environment variable HFC_LOGGING to pass in configurations in the following format: { 'error': 'error.log', // 'error' logs are printed to file 'error.log' relative of the current working dir for node.js 'debug': '/tmp/myapp/debug.log', // 'debug' and anything more critical ('info', 'warn', 'error') can also be an absolute path 'info': 'console' // 'console' is a keyword for logging to console } Parameters: Name Type Description logger Object a logger instance that defines the following methods: debug(), info(), warn(), error() with string interpolation methods like util.format. createChannel(request) Calls the orderer to start building the new channel. Only one of the application instances needs to call this method.

The returned object may then be signed using the signChannelConfig() method of this class. Once the all signatures have been collected this object and the signatures may be used on the updateChannel or createChannel requests. Parameters: Name Type Description The Array.&lt;byte&gt; bytes of the ConfigEnvelope protopuf Returns: The bytes of the ConfigUpdate protobuf Type Array.&lt;byte&gt; getChain(name) Get a Chain instance from the state storage. This allows existing chain instances to be saved for retrieval later and to be shared among instances of the application. Note that it’s the application/SDK’s responsibility to record the chain information. If an application is not able to look up the chain information from storage, it may call another API that queries one or more Peers for that information. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the chain. Throws: if the state store has not been set or a chain does not exist under that name. Type Error Returns: The chain instance Type Chain getStateStore() A convenience method for obtaining the state store object in use for this client. Returns: The KeyValueStore implementation object set within this Client, or null if it does not exist. Type KeyValueStore getUserContext(name, checkPersistence) Returns the user with the signing identity. This can be a synchronous call or asynchronous call, depending on whether &quot;checkPersistent&quot; is truthy or not. If truthy, the method is asynchronous and returns a Promise, otherwise it's synchronous. As explained above, the client instance can have an optional state store. The SDK saves enrolled users in the storage which can be accessed by authorized users of the application (authentication is done by the application outside of the SDK). This function attempts to load the user by name from the local storage (via the KeyValueStore interface). The loaded user object must represent an enrolled user with a valid enrollment certificate signed by a trusted CA (such as the CA server). Parameters: Name Type Description name String Optional. If not specified, will only return the in-memory user context object, or null if not found in memory. If &quot;name&quot; is specified, will also attempt to load it from the state store if search in memory failed. checkPersistence boolean Optional. If specified and truthy, the method returns a Promise and will attempt to check the state store for the requested user by the &quot;name&quot;. If not specified or falsey, the method is synchronous and returns the requested user from memory Returns: The user object corresponding to the name, or null if the user does not exist or if the state store has not been set. Type Promise installChaincode(request) Sends an install proposal to one or more endorsing peers. Parameters: Name Type Description request Object An object containing the following fields: `chaincodePath` : required - String of the path to location of the source code of the chaincode `chaincodeId` : required - String of the name of the chaincode `chaincodeVersion` : required - String of the version of the chaincode `chaincodePackage` : optional - Byte array of the archive content for the chaincode source.

If not found, do nothing. Returns: A Promise for a {User} object upon successful restore, or if the user by the name does not exist in the state store, returns null without rejecting the promise Type Promise newChain(name) Returns a chain instance with the given name. This represents a channel and its associated ledger (as explained above), and this call returns an empty object. To initialize the chain in the blockchain network, a list of participating endorsers and orderer peers must be configured first on the returned object. Parameters: Name Type Description name string The name of the chain. Recommend using namespaces to avoid collision. Throws: if the chain by that name already exists in the application's state store Type Error Returns: The uninitialized chain instance. Type Chain newCryptoKeyStore(KVSImplClass, opts) Returns a new instance of the CryptoKeyStore. When the application needs to use a key store other than the default, it should create a new CryptoKeyStore and set it on the CryptoSuite. cryptosuite.setCryptoKeyStore(client.newCryptoKeyStore(KVSImplClass, opts)) Parameters: Name Type Description KVSImplClass function Optional.

If specified, the value of the argument must point to a module implementing the KeyValueStore interface. opts object Implementation-specific option object used in the constructor returns a new instance of the CryptoKeystore newCryptoSuite(setting) Returns a new instance of the CryptoSuite API implementation. Creating a new CryptoSuite is optional and should be used if options other than defaults are needed. This instance should be set on the User and the Fabric CA Client. If not specified, an instance of CryptoSuite will be constructed based on the current configuration settings: crypto-hsm: use an implementation for Hardware Security Module (if set to true) or software-based key management (if set to false) crypto-keysize: security level, or key size, to use with the digital signature public key algorithm. Currently ECDSA is supported and the valid key sizes are 256 and 384 crypto-hash-algo: hashing algorithm key-value-store: some CryptoSuite implementation requires a key store to persist private keys. A CryptoKeyStore is provided for this purpose, which can be used on top of any implementation of the KeyValueStore interface, such as a file-based store or a database-based one. The specific implementation is determined by the value of this configuration setting. Parameters: Name Type Description setting object This optional parameter is an object with the following optional properties: - software {boolean}: Whether to load a software-based implementation (true) or HSM implementation (false) default is true (for software based implementation), specific implementation module is specified in the setting 'crypto-suite-software' - keysize {number}: The key size to use for the crypto suite instance. default is value of the setting 'crypto-keysize' - algorithm {string}: Digital signature algorithm, currently supporting ECDSA only with value &quot;EC&quot; - hash {string}: 'SHA2' or 'SHA3' returns a new instance of the CryptoSuite API implementation newMSP() build an new MSP with the definition.

Returns: A Promise for the user context object upon successful save Type Promise setDevMode() Set dev mode to true or false. setStateStore(keyValueStore) The enrollment materials for Users that have appeared in the instances of the application. The SDK should have a built-in key value store file-based implementation to allow easy setup during development. Production systems would use a store backed by database for more robust storage and clustering, so that multiple app instances can share app state via the database. This API makes this pluggable so that different store implementations can be selected by the application. Parameters: Name Type Description keyValueStore KeyValueStore Instance of an alternative KeyValueStore implementation provided by the consuming app. setUserContext(user, skipPersistence) Sets an instance of the User class as the security context of self client instance. This user’s credentials (ECert), or special transaction certificates that are derived from the user's ECert, will be used to conduct transactions and queries with the blockchain network. Upon setting the user context, the SDK saves the object in a persistence cache if the “state store” has been set on the Client instance. If no state store has been set, this cache will not be established and the application is responsible for setting the user context again if the application crashes and is recovered. Parameters: Name Type Description user User An instance of the User class encapsulating the authenticated user’s signing materials (private key and enrollment certificate) skipPersistence boolean Whether to skip saving the user object into persistence. Default is false and the method will attempt to save the user object to the state store.

The Peer class represents the remote Peer node and its network membership materials, aka the ECert used to verify signatures. Peer membership represents organizations, unlike User membership which represents individuals. When constructed, a Peer instance can be designated as an event source, in which case a “eventSourceUrl” attribute should be configured. This allows the SDK to automatically attach transaction event listeners to the event stream. It should be noted that Peer event streams function at the Peer level and not at the chain and chaincode levels. new Peer(url, opts) Constructs a Peer given its endpoint configuration settings. Parameters: Name Type Description url string The URL with format of &quot;grpcs://host:port&quot;. opts Object The options for the connection to the peer. - request-timeout {string} A integer value in milliseconds to be used as node.js based timeout. This will break the request operation if the grpc request has not responded within this timeout period. note: other options will be passed to the grpc connection Methods addListener(eventType, eventTypeData, eventCallback) For a Peer that is connected to eventSource, the addListener registers an EventCallBack for a set of event types. addListener can be invoked multiple times to support differing EventCallBack functions receiving different types of events. Note that the parameters below are optional in certain languages, like Java, that constructs an instance of a listener interface, and pass in that instance as the parameter. Parameters: Name Type Description eventType string : ie. Block, Chaincode, Transaction eventTypeData object : Object Specific for event type as necessary, currently needed for “Chaincode” event type, specifying a matching pattern to the event name set in the chaincode(s) being executed on the target Peer, and for “Transaction” event type, specifying the transaction ID eventCallback class Client Application class registering for the callback. Returns: An ID reference to the event listener. Type string connectEventSource() Since practically all Peers are event producers, when constructing a Peer instance, an application can designate it as the event source for the application. Typically only one of the Peers on a Chain needs to be the event source, because all Peers on the Chain produce the same events. This method tells the SDK which Peer(s) to use as the event source for the client application. It is the responsibility of the SDK to manage the connection lifecycle to the Peer’s EventHub. It is the responsibility of the Client Application to understand and inform the selected Peer as to which event types it wants to receive and the call back functions to use. Returns: This gives the app a handle to attach “success” and “error” listeners Type Promise getEnrollmentCertificate() Returns the Peer's enrollment certificate. Returns: Certificate in PEM format signed by the trusted CA Type object getName() Get the Peer name. Required property for the instance objects. Returns: The name of the Peer Type string getRoles() Get the user’s roles the Peer participates in. It’s an array of possible values in “client”, and “auditor”. The member service defines two more roles reserved for peer membership: “peer” and “validator”, which are not exposed to the applications. Returns: The roles for this user. Type Array.&lt;string&gt; isEventListened(eventName, chain) A network call that discovers if at least one listener has been connected to the target Peer for a given event. This helps application instance to decide whether it needs to connect to the event source in a crash recovery or multiple instance instantiation. Parameters: Name Type Description eventName string required chain Chain optional removeListener(eventListenerRef) Unregisters a listener. Parameters: Name Type Description eventListenerRef string Reference returned by SDK for event listener.

The ECert must have been signed by one of the CAs the blockchain network has been configured to trust. An enrolled user (having a signing key and ECert) can conduct chaincode instantiate, transactions and queries with the Chain. User ECerts can be obtained from a CA beforehand as part of installing and instantiating the application, or it can be obtained from the optional Fabric CA service via its enrollment process. Sometimes User identities are confused with Peer identities. User identities represent signing capability because it has access to the private key, while Peer identities in the context of the application/SDK only has the certificate for verifying signatures. An application cannot use the Peer identity to sign things because the application doesn’t have access to the Peer identity’s private key. new User(cfg) Constructor for a member.

At a high level, a business application against a Hyperledger Fabric network is made up of two parts: chaincode that runs in the servers (endorser nodes), and client code that runs in the client application. For chaincode development, please visit the tutorial here. The following tutorial assumes a chaincode has been developed and the focus is developing the client application. What makes up a Hyperledger Fabric application development environment?Below you'll find a high level summary of the Hyperledger Fabric design aimed at an introductory level of understanding, so that you can be on your way to setting up the development environment. For a comprehensive description of the concepts, the architecture, please visit the official Hyperledger Fabric documentation. First of all, you will need an orderer. But isn't an orderer responsible for the consensus? Why start here? It's true that the main responsibility of the ordering service of a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network is to provide consensus on a transaction among the maintainers of the ledger, a.k.a the committer nodes. However, the ordering service also maintains critical data about the overall network: what organizations are participating, what channels have been created, which organizations are part of a given channel, and last but not least what policies are in place for any kind of changes to the network. In essence, the ordering service holds the network together. Ok we've got to have an orderer node so we can add participating organizations to it and get a network started. Next you would need peers for each participating organization in order to participate in transaction endorsing and maintaining the ledger. The peer nodes play two roles: endorser and committer. A peer's endorser role may be enabled or disabled based on bootstrap configuration. But all peers are always committers. For high availability you would want more than one peer for each organization in a real deployment. But for the development environment, one peer per organization is sufficient under most circumstances. This peer will be both an endorse and a committer. It will be sent transaction proposals to endorse, and queries to discover information from the ledger. Another important role that peer nodes play is broadcasting events to interested parties. Whenever a block is added to the ledger, an event is sent by the peer through a dedicated streaming port. Any applications within the organization can register themselves to listen on that port to get notified. The final piece of the puzzle is identities. Every operation in a Hyperledger Fabric network must be digitially signed for the purposes of access control, or provenance/auditing (who did what), or both. As of v1.0, identities are based on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)) standards. Every orderer node, peer node and every user/transactor must have a key pair with the public key wrapped in a x.509 certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). Since x.509 is an open standard, Hyperledger Fabric would work with any existing certificate authorities. But it's typically a painful process with lots of potential red taping to get real certificates, so for development purposes it is a popular practice to use self-signed certificates locally generated. As you will see in the later section, the fabric provides tools to make this less painful. Also related to identities, you should make a decision on whether Fabric-CA should be part of your solution. This is a server with REST APIs that supports dynamic identity management with registration, enrollment (getting certificates), revocation and re-enrollment. So it is very useful in providing user identities on the fly. But note that user identities provisioned this way are only of the MEMBER role in the fabric, which means it won't be able to perform certain operations reserved for the ADMIN role: create/update channel install/instantiate chaincode query installed/instantiated chaincodes For these privileged operations, the client must use an ADMIN user to submit the request. This will be discussed in more details in the User identities tutorial. If you choose to not use Fabric-CA, everything will still work but the application is responsible for managing the user certificates. This will be discussed in more details in the User identities tutorial. PrerequisitesYou will need the following software: Docker - v1.12 or higher Docker Compose - v1.8 or higher Nodejs v6.2.0 - 6.10.0 ( Node v7+ is not supported ) Prepare crypto materialsAs discussed above, identities are established with x.509 certificates. If you think about it, we will need a whole bunch of certificates because there are many identities involved: peers need identities to sign endorsements orderers need identities to sign proposed blocks for the committers to validate and append to the ledger applications need identities to sign transaction requests even the Fabric CA themselves also need identities so their signatures in the certificates can be validated Luckily there is a tool for that. Follow this guide to use the cryptogen tool to generate all the required keys and certificates in one swoop. Recommend the following configuration: Organization # of nodes # of users orderer org 1 orderer 1 admin peer org1 2 peers 1 admin, 1 member peer org2 2 peers 1 admin, 1 member Note that the cryptogen tool will automatically generate identities for the Fabric CA nodes for each orderer and peer organization, which can be used to start the Fabric-CA servers (if you choose to use it as part of the solution as discussed above). In addition, it also generates one admin user of the ADMIN role with the privileges to perform admin-level operations listed above. Finally, it also generates regular users (MEMBER role) for submitting transactions. This would get us all the crypto materials needed to start things up. Getting things rolling for real - the genesis blockAs discussed above, the orderer should be the first step to bootstrap to launch a network. It will need the initial configurations wrapped inside a genesis block. Follow the instructions here to use the congigtxgen tool to generate that. The output, the genesis block for the orderer, will be used in the next step to launch the orderer node. Start the network (no TLS)Now we are ready to put it all together. The easiest way to launch the development environment is to use docker-compose. Follow the instructions here to start the network. To minimize the chance to make mistakes, we will run the network without TLS. The above steps give you a development environment. Now before you can ask it to process any transactions, you must first create a channel. Next, we will create a channel in this tutorial. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on 2017-05-18T23:57:23-04:00 using the DocStrap template.

The SDK is designed to be used in the Node.js JavaScript runtime. OverviewHyperledger Fabric is the operating system of an enterprise-strength permissioned blockchain network. For a high-level overview of the fabric, visit http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Applications can be developed to interact with the blockchain network on behalf of the users. APIs are available to: create channels ask peer nodes to join the channel install chaincodes in peers instantiate chaincodes in a channel invoke transactions by calling the chaincode query the ledger for transactions or blocks How Different Components of the Fabric Work TogetherThe Transaction Flow document provides an excellent description of the application/SDK, peers, and orderers working together to process transactions and producing blocks. Security on the Fabric is enforced with digital signatures. All requests made to the fabric must be signed by users with appropriate enrollment certificates. For a user's enrollment certificate to be considered valid on the Fabric, it must be signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Fabric supports any standard CAs. In addition, Fabric provides a CA server. See this overview. Features of the SDK for Node.jsThe Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js is designed in an Object-Oriented programming style. Its modular construction enables application developers to plug in alternative implementations of key functions such as crypto suites, the state persistence store, and logging utility. The SDK's list of features include: fabric-client: create a new channel send channel information to a peer to join install chaincode on a peer instantiate chaincode in a channel, which involves two steps: propose and transact submitting a transaction, which also involves two steps: propose and transact query a chaincode for the latest application state various query capabilities: chain height block-by-number, block-by-hash all channels that a peer is part of all installed chaincodes in a peer all instantiated chaincodes in a channel transaction-by-id channel configuration data monitoring events: connect to a peer's event stream listen on block events listen on transactions events and find out if the transaction was successfully committed to the ledger or marked invalid listen on custom events produced by chaincodes serializable User object with signing capabilities hierarchical configuration settings with multiple layers of overrides: files, environment variable, program arguments, in-memory settings logging utility with a built-in logger (winston) and can be overriden with a number of popular loggers including log4js and bunyan pluggable CryptoSuite interface describe the cryptographic operations required for successful interactions with the Fabric. Two implementations are provided out of box: Software-based ECDSA PKCS#11-compliant ECDSA pluggable State Store interface for persisting state caches such as users File-based store CouchDB-base store which works with both CouchDB database and IBM Cloudant customizable Crypto Key Store for any software-based cryptographic suite implementation supports both TLS (grpcs://) or non-TLS (grpc://) connections to peers and orderers, see Remote which is the superclass for peers and orderers fabric-ca-client: register a new user enroll a user to obtain the enrollment certificate signed by the Fabric CA revoke an existing user by enrollment ID or revoke a specific certificate customizable persistence store API ReferenceThe SDK is made up of 3 top-level modules that can be accessed through the navigation menu Modules: api: pluggable APIs for application developers to supply alternative implementations of key interfaces used by the SDK. For each interface there are built-in default implementations. fabric-client: this module provides APIs to interact with the core components of a Hypreledger Fabric-based blockchain network, namely the peers, orderers and event streams. fabric-ca-client: this module provides APIs to interact with the optional component, fabric-ca, that contains services for membership management. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.3 on 2017-05-18T23:57:23-04:00 using the DocStrap template.
